This is the complete DAL with our custom code included. Therefore if you build a micro:bit project using this modified-DAL, the micro:bit will sense and drive a mega:bit, if plugged in. 


The modified files can also be found in [Design History  /  Software  /  code](https://github.com/LukeB101/Mega-Bit/tree/master/Design%20History/Software/code)
