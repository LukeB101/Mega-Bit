Here you will find the four printed circuit boards we developed along with a [document](https://github.com/LukeB101/Mega-Bit/blob/master/Design%20History/Hardware/PCB/PCB%20Design%20History.pdf) describing the development process.

Please note that BOMs may include placeholder resistors and capacitors which are designed to allow open circuits or solder bridges for modularity in the PCB design.

These will not be in the final design.
